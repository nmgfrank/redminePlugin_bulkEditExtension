As the original bulk edit is not enough in the actual application, this plugin adds several expanded functions.

####1. Search Assignee 
In the origin system, you can only choose the assignee from the select list. If there are many users in the list, it will be quite inconvenience to find the assignee. The plugin adds a search button beside the select list, so that you can easily find out the assignee   
with the help of it.
